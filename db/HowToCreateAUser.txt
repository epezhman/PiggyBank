This is a good tutorial about creating users:
--------------------------------------------
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-new-user-and-grant-permissions-in-mysql

Or you do it like that:
----------------------
1- Log on to MySQL by typing the following in a terminal:
> mysql -u root -p

2- Create a user:
> CREATE USER 'piggy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '8aa259f4c7';

3-Add privileges to the user:
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON  piggybank.* TO 'piggy'@'localhost';

4- Commit the changes:
> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

5- Revoke the "DROP" privilege from the user:
> REVOKE DROP ON piggybank.* FROM 'piggy'@'localhost';

6- Commit the changes again.
> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

7- Quit, if you want :)
> quit
